                Acrylic sheets are flat, rigid plastic panels made from acrylic material. They're highly transparent and
                offer excellent optical clarity, making them a popular choice for applications where glass might be used
                but weight and shatter resistance are important factors. Acrylic sheets are often used for windows,
                skylights, signs, protective barriers, displays, and various DIY projects. They can be cut, drilled, and
                shaped easily using common tools. If you have further questions about acrylic sheets or their
                properties, feel free to ask!

                polycarbonate sheets are often referred to as "unbreakable" because of their exceptional impact
                resistance. They are much stronger than traditional glass and acrylic sheets, making them a popular
                choice for applications where durability and safety are essential, such as in construction, security
                glazing, and protective barriers. However, while they are highly resistant to breaking, it's important
                to note that extreme force or improper handling can still lead to damage.
