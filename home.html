        <h1>What is industrial polymers?</h1>
        <h3>
            Industrial polymers are large molecules made up of repeating units called monomers. They play a crucial role
            in a wide range of industries due to their versatility, durability, and various properties. These polymers
            are used to create an array of products, from everyday items to specialized components in different sectors.

            <h4>
                There are two main types of industrial polymers: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics.
                Thermoplastics can be melted and molded repeatedly, while thermosetting plastics undergo a chemical
                change during curing and cannot be remelted. Engineering plastics are a subset of thermoplastics known
                for their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties that make them suitable for industrial and
                engineering applications.

        <figure class="animate__animated animate__bounceInDown">
            <h4>
                Polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and nylon are some common thermoplastics used in industrial
                applications. For more specialized properties, polymer composites or blends are developed by combining
                different polymers or adding fillers and reinforcements.

                The industrial polymer sector continues to innovate, exploring new materials, manufacturing processes,
                and applications across industries such as automotive, electronics, packaging, construction, and more.

        <h1>What is engineering plastics</h1>
            <h3>
            Engineering plastics are a group of materials that exhibit enhanced mechanical, thermal, and chemical
            properties compared to standard plastics. They are designed to withstand demanding conditions and are often
            used in various industries for their strength, durability, and performance. Some common examples of
            engineering plastics include polycarbonate, polyamide (nylon), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and
            acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). These plastics find applications in automotive, aerospace,
            electronics, medical devices, and more due to their ability to replace traditional materials like metal and
            glass in certain situations. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about engineering plastics?
